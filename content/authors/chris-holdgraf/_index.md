Chris is a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics and a Community Architect with the Division of Data Science at Berkeley. His background is in cognitive and computational neuroscience, where he used predictive models to understand the auditory system in the human brain. He is also a team member of Project Jupyter, with a focus on how infrastructure can support interactive computing workflows in research and education. He's interested in the boundary between technology, open-source software, and scientific workflows, as well as how open communities can support and extend these workflows in a way that makes science more impactful and inclusive.
