2i2c is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting tools and workflows
for interactive computing in science and education. It provides hosted cloud
services for interactive computing workflows with Jupyter and the data
science software ecosystem. It also builds and supports open source tools in
this ecosystem.

What is 2i2c and why does it exist?  We are a non-profit organization with a
core mission dedicated to supporting interactive computing in science and
education. We aim to be an ideal partner for universities, government labs, and
other research institutes who need cloud-based data science environments with
Jupyter and beyond.

2i2c's team is made up of researchers, technologists, and evangelists who have
spent several years running cloud infrastructure for science and education. This
includes the UC Berkeley DataHub - a JupyterHub for teaching data science that
is used by thousands of students each day, the Pangeo project - a community
platform for Big Data geoscience, and Syzygy - an interactive computing provider
for universities across Canada. 

We have learned the value of interactive computing and the cloud for science and
education, but have learned how difficult it is to deploy, customize, and manage
this infrastructure. In addition, the open source tools that underlie this
infrastructure need support, development, and input from the scientific
community in order to improve and thrive.

2i2c exists to address both of these challenges.

### What does 2i2c do?

2i2c makes it easier for researchers, educators, and students to access
interactive computing environments with cloud infrastructure. It does so by
offering hosted data environments in the cloud, running entirely on open source
tools. It also provides consultation and guidance to organizations that wish to
run this infrastructure with their own hardware or personnel.

2i2c supports open tools and communities in the Jupyter and scientific computing
ecosystem. It does this by providing technical development and collaboration to
researchers and educators, with the goal of improving tools in open data science
by solving problems in science and education. 2i2c also provides core technical
and community support for key open source tools.
