_2i2c is supported through a mix of philanthropic support, grants from foundations and federal agencies, and revenue generated through its Managed JupyterHubs service._


2i2c is lucky to receive support from several organizations. This support makes it possible for 2i2c to accomplish its mission, and have impact across research and education.

As a sustainability focused non-profit, 2i2c aims to generate funding from a variety of sources, and towards different ends. It aims to have a balance between "research and development" funding, such as grants and foundation awards, as well as "fee for service" revenue generated from managing JupyterHub infrastructure and performing development for other projects. We continue to explore business models that both grow our capacity to support research and education through interactive computing, and that assist us in supporting open source communities.

2i2c receives direct support from the following institutions.
