## Projects

2i2c has worked on projects in interactive computing infrastructure for several
years now. Its team members are core contributors or project leads on the following
services and tools:

### The UC Berkeley DataHubs

The DataHubs at UC Berkeley are a collection of JupyterHubs used across the
university's data science courses. These hubs serve thousands of students
across a variety of courses. 2i2c's team has helped build and maintain these
hubs, and also assists the university in integrating pedagogical content with
the datahubs.

### The Pangeo Project

The Pangeo project is a community platform for Big Data geoscience. It runs several
JupyterHubs and BinderHubs for geoscience communities, and is a pioneer in integrating
open source technology and standards with cloud infrastructure to facilitate access
and computation with extremely large datasets.

### Syzygy

The Syzygy service provides interactive computing environments to over 18 institutions
across Canada. It is based out of the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences.
Syzygy runs JupyterHubs for thousands of users across a variety of research and education
use-cases.

### mybinder.org

Mybinder.org is a massively-open free service for reproducible, sharable interactive
computing environments. It serves over 100,000 users each week, and has been one of the
driving services behind improvements to JupyterHub on Kubernetes and the reproducible
environments tool, repo2docker.

### The Jupyter Project

In addition to the services above, many 2i2c members have spent several years as
core Jupyter Project maintainers. They have used their experiences in research and
education to improve core tools in infrastructure with JupyterHub, interfaces for
learning and research with the Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab, and tools for
scholarship such as Jupyter Book.
