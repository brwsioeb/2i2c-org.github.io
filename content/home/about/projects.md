## Projects

2i2c has worked on projects in interactive computing infrastructure for several
years now. Its team members are core contributors or project leads on the following
services and tools:

### The UC Berkeley DataHubs

[The DataHubs at UC Berkeley](https://ucbds-infra.github.io/ds-course-infra-guide/intro.html)
are a collection of JupyterHubs used across the
university's data science courses. These hubs serve thousands of students
across a variety of courses. 2i2c's team has helped build and maintain these
hubs, and also assists the university in integrating pedagogical content with
the datahubs.

### The Pangeo Project

The [Pangeo project](http://pangeo.io/) is a community platform for Big Data geoscience. It runs several
JupyterHubs and BinderHubs for geoscience communities, and is a pioneer in integrating
open source technology and standards with cloud infrastructure to facilitate access
and computation with extremely large datasets.

### Syzygy

The [Syzygy service](https://syzygy.ca/) provides interactive computing environments to over 18 institutions
across Canada. It is based out of the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences (PIMS).
Syzygy runs JupyterHubs for thousands of users across a variety of research and education
use-cases.

### mybinder.org

[Mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) is a massively-open free service for reproducible, sharable interactive
computing environments. It serves over 100,000 users each week, and has been one of the
driving services behind improvements to JupyterHub on Kubernetes and the reproducible
environments tool, repo2docker.

### Callysto

[Callysto](https://callysto.ca/) is a free, interactive, curriculum-based learning and skills development tool —
think “interactive textbook” — that can be accessed from any device with an internet
connection. It was created by Cybera and PIMS to help students strengthen their
computational thinking, coding, and data science skills. Callysto builds open education
resources and training programs for teachers and students in grades 5-12 that leverage a
cloud-hosted interactive computing platform.

### The Jupyter Project

In addition to the services above, many 2i2c members have spent several years as
core [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org) maintainers. They have used their experiences in research and
education to improve core tools in infrastructure with [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io), interfaces for
learning and research with the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io)
and [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io), and tools for
scholarship such as [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org).
