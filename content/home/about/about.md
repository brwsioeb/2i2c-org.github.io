# What is 2i2c?

2i2c is a non-profit organization with a mission to facilitate interactive
computing in science and education. It has the following core goals:

* provide hosted cloud services for interactive computing with Jupyter and the data
  science software ecosystem.
* collaborate with researchers and educators using expertise in infrastructure and tools
  in interactive computing.
* build and support open source tools and communities in this ecosystem.

2i2c's team is made up of researchers, technologists, and evangelists who have
[spent several years running cloud infrastructure for science and education](#projects).
We have learned the value of interactive computing and the cloud for science and
education, but have realized how difficult it is to deploy, customize, and manage
this infrastructure. In addition, the open source tools that underlie this
infrastructure need support, development, and input from the scientific
community in order to improve and thrive. 2i2c exists to address these challenges,
and improve the state of interactive computing in research and education.

## What does 2i2c do?

**2i2c makes it easier for researchers, educators, and students to access
interactive computing environments with cloud infrastructure.** It does so by
offering hosted data environments in the cloud, running entirely on open source
tools. It also provides consultation and guidance to organizations that wish to
run this infrastructure with their own hardware or personnel.

**2i2c supports open tools and communities in the Jupyter and scientific
computing ecosystem.** It does this by providing technical development and
collaboration to researchers and educators, with the goal of improving tools in
open data science by solving problems in science and education.

## Get involved

2i2c is a young organization, and we are actively looking to grow our capacity
to offer cloud services as well as collaborate in research and development.
We also seek to employ technologists with expertise in cloud infrastructure,
dev-ops, and data science, as well as experience in the open source stack of
tools for science and education.
