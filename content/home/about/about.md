2i2c is a non-profit organization with a dual mission:

- Support data workflows in research and education through infrastructure for interactive computing.
- Support open tools and communities that underlie this infrastructure.

It accomplishes this mission by providing hosted cloud services for interactive
computing with Jupyter and the data science software ecosystem, by collaborating
with researchers and educators to leverage and tailor this infrastructure for specific use-cases,
and by providing support for open source tools and communities in this
ecosystem.
