# Kinds of hubs

2i2c Hubs are extremely flexible and customizable, and can generally meet most
use-cases in research and education. There are 4 kinds of JupyterHub configurations
we have found to be very common, and might help you think about what kinda JupyterHub
configuration you want.

## JupyterHub for your class

Teaching a class with data science elements? Get yourself a JupyterHub where
your students can log-in with easily, and start immediately working
with your pedagogical materials. Pick from a list of curated data science
environments, or bring your own with a standard Docker image. 

If you're interested in using a 2i2c managed JupyterHub for your class,
[send us an email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>](mailto:hello@2i2c.org).

## JupyterHub for your educational institute

Universities and departments with many classes, instructors and students
need more control over their JupyterHubs. You might want single sign-on integration with
your university's authentication system, deep integration with your learning
management system, administrative control on what kinda resources different
classes get, etc. We will run the hub *with* you - involving your staff as
much (or as little) as you want, so you can build local expertise in running
the hub within your organization.

## JupyterHub for your research group

Research groups now need easy access to fast, scalable compute very near their
data. ????

## JupyterHub for your event

Running a data science hackathon or workshop? Get yurself a JupyterHub fit with your 
custom environment and preloaded with your data! Your participants won't spend time
setting up their environment or downloading data over possibly flaky wifi. You won't
spend time doing tech support for installation or download errors. Pay for your
infrastructure use just for the duration of your event, with dedicated support
during your event if needed.
