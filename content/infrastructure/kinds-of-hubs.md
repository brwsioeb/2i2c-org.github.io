# Kinds of JupyterHubs that we support

JupyterHubs are flexible and customizable, and can generally meet most
use-cases in research and education. There are 4 kinds of JupyterHub configurations
we have found to be very common. We put extra emphasis on supporting these
use-cases, which we'll describe below.

## JupyterHub for your class

Teaching a class with data science elements? JupyterHub allows
your students to log-in remotely with a pre-configured environment designed
to connect to pedagogical materials. Pick from a list of curated data science
environments, or bring your own with a standard Docker image.
We will work with you to deploy and manage JupyterHub infrastructure for your
learning environment.

If you're interested in using a 2i2c managed JupyterHub for your class,
[send us an email <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i>](mailto:hello@2i2c.org).

## JupyterHub for your research team

JupyterHub can provide access to data, collaborators, scalable computing, and
a variety of other tools that accelerate research and discovery. If you have large
data sets, want a centralized place for your team to analyze data and collaborate,
or wish to provide access to powerful cloud infrastructure, JupyterHub is an excellent
tool to use. We will work with your research team to deploy and manage a JupyterHub
that is designed for scalable research use-cases.

## JupyterHub for your institution

Universities and departments with many classes, instructors, and students
need more control over their JupyterHubs. You might want single sign-on integration with
your university's authentication system, deep integration with your learning
management system, administrative control on what kinda resources different
classes get, etc. We will deploy and manage JupyterHub infrastructure in partnership
with your organization - involving your staff as much (or as little) as you want.
This not only provides a JupyterHub for your community, but also provides you
opportunity and support to run the infrastructure yourselves one day.

## JupyterHubs for your event

Running a data science hackathon or workshop? JupyterHub is a useful way to provide
your participants a pre-configured environment and a common space to collaborate
and explore data. You won't lose time setting up everyone's environment, debugging
issues due to version mis-matches, or slowing down large data downloads due
to flaky wifi. We will work with your event team to deploy and manage a JupyterHub
for your event, with dedicated support during your event if needed.
