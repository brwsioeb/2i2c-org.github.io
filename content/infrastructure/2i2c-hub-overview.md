# What is in a 2i2c Hub?

A 2i2c Hub is a collection of open source tools that provide interactive computing environments in the cloud. JupyterHub is the lynchpin that ties everything together. It handles user accounts, provides the interactive environment, and connects users with computational and data resources.

Every 2i2c Hub is tailored for the community that uses it. 2i2c Hubs can run on almost any kind of cloud infrastructure (or even your own local hardware), provide a customizable environment for your needs, and they are built with 100% open source and community-driven software.

For more information about the 2i2c Hubs, see [the 2i2c Hubs Pilot documentation](https://2i2c.org/pilot/infrastructure.html).
