2i2c is founded by leaders in the research, education, and open source community. We have [years of experience in deploying infrastructure for interactive computing](#projects), as well as integrating that infrastructure into institutional pedagogy and research efforts. In addition, we are core contributors to many large open source projects in the Jupyter community.

We created 2i2c because of the successes that we witnessed at our institutions in empowering reserach and improving education through interactive computing. 2i2c is an attempt at bringing that success to the broader research and education community by providing expertise, development, and support for open source tools in interactive computing in the cloud.
