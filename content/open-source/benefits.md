Using open infrastructure has several advantages:

- **Powerful, flexible, and dynamic**. Open source tools are the best for accelerating research and empowering improving education.
- **Flexibility and freedom**. Open source tools run on many kinds of infrastructure and to avoid vendor lock-in. You can run the entire 2i2c stack on your own if you wish!
- **Standards in data science**. Open source tools are the most-common toolchain across all research fields as well as outside of academia.
- **Align with your values**. Open source tools are controlled and owned by a broad and divverse community that is dedicated to the public good.
- **Accessible to all**. Open tools are free to use and deploy, making research and education more accessible to people around the world.
