2i2c believes that open source infrastructure and tools are the best choice for researchers and educators. We also believe in giving back to these tools and their communities to ensure that they continue to thrive.

2i2c integrates an entirely open stack with hosted infrastructure that is tailored for research and education, running in the cloud infrastructure of your choice. It also contributes back to the communities that develop and grow these tools, keeping the ecosystem healthy.

## What is open source?

There are many kinds of open source projects out there. The ones that 2i2c supports are developed, controlled, and owned by the community. We believe in the importance of tools that are built by a diverse community of multiple stakeholders, in order to build tools that are powerful for all of us, and in an equitable and inclusive manner.

Open source tools exist across all parts of the data science stack - from the domain-specific libraries you use to analyze data, to the interfaces that allow you to interact with the computer, to the software that orchestrates your workflow in the cloud. 2i2c believes it is crucial that research and education has access to open source tools across **all layers of this stack**.
